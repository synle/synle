### Hi there 👋

#### 💬 About Me
I am **Sy Le**, a seasoned software engineer with over a decade of experience, I've honed my skills in developing cutting-edge web applications at renowned companies such as Linkedin, Salesforce, and Yahoo. My expertise spans a diverse range of domains, including CRM, marketing automation, e-commerce, and monitoring platforms. I have a strong command of both JavaScript and React on the front end, as well as Node JS and Express on the backend.

I am actively seeking employment opportunities, particularly in front-end development or full-stack positions with an emphasis on the frontend. While I have a preference for fully remote positions, I am also open to hybrid roles that involve commuting to the South Bay Area (Mountain View, CA). I am adaptable to various technology stacks and am willing to learn whatever is necessary to successfully complete the job. Proficient in Typescript and Node.js, I also possess a solid working understanding of Python and Java.
